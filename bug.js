This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has fully mounted.  This often happens within the `constructor` or before the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method has been called. For example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log(this.props.someProp); // Potential error here
  }
  render() {
    return <Text>Hello</Text>;
  }
}
```

In this case, `this.props.someProp` might be undefined because the component hasn't received its props yet.
