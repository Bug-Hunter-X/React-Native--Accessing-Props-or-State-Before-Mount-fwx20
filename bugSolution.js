The solution is to access props and state only after the component has mounted, ideally within the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.  If you need a default value before mounting, set it in the component's state within the `constructor`. 

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      someValue: null // Default value
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.props.someProp); // Access props here
    // Access state using this.state.someValue
  }
  render() {
    return <Text>Hello</Text>;
  }
}
```

By using `componentDidMount`, we guarantee that the component has fully mounted and received its props before accessing them.
